# Examples

All examples can be bootstapped and run with `yarn bootstrap && yarn start`

Since Warthog uses TypeORM and type-graphql out of the box, you can also
Eject from Warthog for custom things and use their examples:

- [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/tree/master/sample)
- [type-graphql](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql/tree/master/examples)
