## Warthog

Opinionated framework for building GraphQL APIs with strong conventions.  With 
Warthog, set up your data models and the following are automatically generated:

- Database schema - generated by [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm)
- Your entire GraphQL Schema including:
  - types to match your entities - generated by [type-graphql](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql)
  - GraphQL inputs for consistent creates, updates, filtering, and pagination
    inspired by [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)'s conventions
- A [graphql-binding](https://github.com/graphql-binding/graphql-binding) for
  type-safe programmatic access to your APIs.

## Install

```bash
yarn add warthog
```
